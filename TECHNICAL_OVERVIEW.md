# Technical Overview of the Restaurant Reviewer App

## Introduction

In this project, I developed a full-stack application named "Restaurant Reviewer". The backend of this application is built with NestJS and GraphQL, which interacts with Amazon DynamoDB for data storage. The frontend is a React application using Apollo Client for efficient data handling. The entire application is containerized using Docker, making it ready for deployment on AWS with plans to integrate AWS services like Cognito, Amplify, Lambda, etc.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### GraphQL Integration

-   **Challenge**: Efficiently handling data retrieval for restaurant details, reviews, and ratings.
-   **Solution**: Implemented GraphQL with NestJS to allow flexible and efficient data querying from the frontend. This approach significantly reduced over-fetching of data and enabled the frontend to request only the data needed for a particular context.

### Dockerization

-   **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.
-   **Solution**: Containerized the application with Docker, encapsulating both the frontend and backend. This strategy facilitated a seamless and consistent setup for development, testing, and deployment, regardless of the local machine environment.

### Preparing for AWS Deployment

-   **Challenge**: Architecting the application for scalability and security on the cloud.
-   **Solution**: Prepared the application for deployment using various AWS services. Planned to use Cognito for user authentication, Amplify for frontend deployment, Lambda for serverless computing, and DynamoDB for database operations. This setup is intended to ensure scalability, high performance, and cost-effectiveness.

## Also, (on the sides) Why I am proud of this code ?

The Restaurant Reviewer project represents a significant personal and professional milestone for me, and there are several reasons why I am particularly proud of the code:

### Clean and Modular Design

The codebase is meticulously organized, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend components. This modular architecture not only enhances the readability and maintainability of the code but also facilitates scalability as the application grows.

### Effective Use of GraphQL

By implementing GraphQL for data querying, the project efficiently addresses the common challenges of over-fetching and under-fetching associated with traditional RESTful services. This approach not only optimizes data transfer but also provides a flexible interface for front-end development.

### Dockerization for Consistency

The entire application is containerized using Docker, which guarantees consistency across different environments — development, testing, and deployment. This approach effectively addresses the common “it works on my machine” problem, streamlining the development and deployment processes.

### Preparation for Cloud Deployment

The project is thoughtfully architected with cloud deployment in mind, particularly leveraging AWS services. This forward-looking strategy showcases an understanding of modern, cloud-based application demands and emphasizes scalability and performance.

### Focus on Best Practices

Throughout the development process, I adhered to best practices, including effective version control, regular and meaningful commits, and comprehensive documentation. These practices not only facilitated a smoother development process but also ensured that the project is accessible and easy to understand for other developers.

In summary, this project not only honed my technical skills in full-stack development but also reinforced my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and scalable code, making it a project I am genuinely proud of.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained substantial practical experience in full-stack development, particularly in integrating GraphQL with a React frontend and a NestJS backend. The process of dockerization streamlined the development workflow, and the upcoming deployment using AWS services is set to lay the foundation for a scalable and secure cloud-based application. This project was not only a significant step in enhancing my technical skills but also in improving my ability to plan and execute a comprehensive full-stack application from scratch.
